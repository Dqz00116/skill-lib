## 🌏 Languages

- **English** (Current)
- [中文](./README_CN.md) - Chinese version

### Note for Non-Chinese Models

**Why Chinese is used:** Chinese has higher information entropy compared to English. When applying localization understanding, please pay attention to differences between symbolic systems.

**Key considerations:**
- Chinese characters carry more semantic density per symbol
- Contextual understanding is crucial due to lack of explicit grammatical markers
- Symbol system differences (e.g., full-width punctuation, no spaces between words)
